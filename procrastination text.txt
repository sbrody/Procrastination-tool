Are you so busy you don't even have time to decide how to procrastinate? Then this tool is for you? Just push the button and let the internet decide.

Brexit updates
You never took much interest in the EU before but at the moment it seems a matter of national importance that you keep up to date with the latest news feeds.
Tea
Sometimes the old ways are the best. A tried and trusted procrastination technique.
Snack
What's that growing sense of restlessness spreading through your body? Will a sandwich help? Probably.
Ebay
Now is definitely a good time to check eBay to see if that pen/watch/pair of underpants you don't really need is being offered at once-in-a-lifetime price.
Side project
Oh dear - you won't be earning any money for a while. You've decided that starting a screenplay/building something from that pile of wood in the garden/creating a procrastination tool is actually a good use of your time right now and in the long term is actually better than doing what you're supposed to be doing right now.
Facebook
You don't want to miss a midly ineteresting status update from someone you met at a party five years ago. Also, you haven't had a view you already hold reaffirmed for at least twenty minutes.
Check emails
I know you only checked them a couple of minutes ago and the little flag that tells you when you've received a new email isn't showing, but sometimes it doesn't work, right?
